# Binary-Classification-Using-CNN-on-Bikes-vs-Cars-Dataset
The project is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras/TensorFlow to classify images of bikes and cars. The model uses multiple convolutional layers, L2 regularization, and other techniques to achieve high precision and recall. Overfitting is minimized through regularization.
